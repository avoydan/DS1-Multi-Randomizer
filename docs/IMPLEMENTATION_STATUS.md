# Implementation status

## Backend adapters

- The minimal `CombinedRandomizerAdapter` boundary is defined for combined item
  and enemy generation requests, progress/log events, and typed results.
- The adapter is currently a side-effect-free placeholder that returns
  `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.
- The adapter is not connected to the generation pipeline and does not execute
  an external randomizer or access game/workspace files.
- A pure, deterministic mapping layer converts combined requests to the
  upstream item/enemy configuration shape, applies parent `enabled` flags, and
  rejects requests with no enabled randomization category.
- A pure, deterministic workspace planner
  (`combinedRandomizerWorkspace.ts`) computes the catalog path, per-seed
  output directory, and `scan`/`patch-enemies` argument vectors for a
  generation run, and refuses to plan a workspace located inside the live
  game directory. It performs no filesystem I/O and never constructs
  `install`/`restore` arguments. See
  `docs/COMBINED_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md` ("Workspace execution proof").
- `kellernz1/ds-randomizer` is selectively vendored (the files needed for
  `DsrDataTool.dll`, plus the minimal JavaScript generation core) and pinned
  at commit
  `f120efe0e95b957b7e76109868c3c9966e22720c` under
  `engines/combined/vendor/` (`UPSTREAM_PIN.md` has the full file list and
  update procedure). `DsrDataTool.dll` builds successfully from this
  vendor directory with a locally-installed .NET 8 SDK; see
  `docs/COMBINED_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md` ("Vendored build proof") for the
  exact command and artifact path.
- `DsrDataToolExecutor` runs only the planner-provided `scan` and
  `patch-enemies` argument vectors through Node `child_process.spawn`, streams
  typed stdout/stderr log events, emits coarse process-status events, and
  returns typed success, process-failure, or spawn-failure results. It is not
  wired into the adapter or generation pipeline yet. Task 1's implementation
  is in commit `5402b447f3d53a1896ca59267fc5fe10461bc071`; its seven
  focused tests, backend build, and backend typecheck passed on 2026-09-27.
  The task remains blocked because Git could not create `.git/index.lock` to
  commit the task's plan/status update under the current filesystem policy.
- The upstream JavaScript generation core is vendored at the same pinned
  commit under `engines/combined/vendor/src/` — five files, the transitive
  closure of `generate()` and `writeOutput()`
  (`core/{config,generator,output,rng}.js`, `data/prototype-data.js`), with a
  closed import graph of Node builtins only. CLI, HTTP, Electron, share-link,
  catalog-loading, and game-detection modules are deliberately excluded.
- `combinedRandomizerCore.ts` is the backend's single loading boundary for
  that core: a computed dynamic `import()` of `file:` URLs resolved from
  `import.meta.url`, hand-written types for the six upstream exports (so the
  vendored bytes stay byte-identical), and typed `JS_CORE_MISSING` /
  `JS_CORE_INCOMPLETE` failures instead of thrown errors. It loads and
  shape-checks the core; it does not call `generate()` or `writeOutput()`
  yet. See `docs/COMBINED_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md` ("JS core vendor proof").
- Vendored-file identity is verified by comparing Git blob object IDs against
  the pinned upstream commit, not by `diff`: `core.autocrlf` rewrites line
  endings on Windows checkout. All twelve vendored files verified; object IDs
  recorded in `engines/combined/vendor/UPSTREAM_PIN.md`.
- Documentation correction: upstream `validateConfig(config, { requireGame })`
  **returns** a `string[]` of errors and never throws. The earlier analysis
  said it throws; consumers must check the returned array.
- Not yet done: a public fork (required by `docs/LICENSING.md` before any
  distribution) and an actual orchestration sequence connecting the JS core,
  the workspace planner, and the DsrDataTool executor. The adapter's
  `generate()` is still `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`; the pipeline does not invoke
  `DsrDataTool.dll` or the JS core yet.
- Known defect, deliberately not fixed here (pipeline wiring is out of scope
  for the vendoring task): `core/pipeline.ts` probes the combined engine at
  `vendor/src/cli.js` and `vendor/DSR-Randomizer.exe`, neither of which
  exists or should — so engine-presence status still reports the combined
  engine as missing. Correct targets are `vendor/src/core/generator.js` and
  the built `DsrDataTool.dll`.
