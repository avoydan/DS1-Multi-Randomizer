# Implementation status

Task 10 implemented the backend FogHost process adapter in
`apps/backend/src/adapters/fogHostProcess.ts`. It writes a typed schema-v1
request to a fresh JSON path, launches `FogHost.exe generate`, reads the
authoritative response, forwards structured progress and plain log text,
and reports host crashes and timeouts as non-retryable typed failures. It
rejects stale response paths and invalid request options before launch. The
Fog status probe now points to the planned `tools/fog-host` project and
executable. Seven focused tests, backend build, and backend typecheck passed
(2026-09-28). `@ds1tr/backend` is 0.11.0. The C# host is still unbuilt;
Task 11 owns compatibility inputs and Task 12 owns pipeline wiring.

Task 9 designed the FogHost integration (`docs/FOGHOST_INTEGRATION.md`;
decision in `docs/DECISIONS.md`). It is docs only: no code changed and there
is no version bump. The design is a console host that compiles FogMod's
engine sources at the audited commit `28711c3`, never FogMod's CLI (which
forces DS3) or WinForms. It forces DS1R and exchanges JSON request/response
files. FogMod writes DS1 output in place, so each attempt gets a fresh staging
directory, and the host cleans up FogMod's `.bak` files. Errors are typed and
retry-scoped (`combined` vs `fog`). The overlap analysis shows stock FogMod is
lossy on combined output:
- it replaces EMEVD and keeps only legacy-enemy-randomizer event IDs;
- it deletes the combined engine's scaled `NpcParam` rows;
- it finds key items only in annotated item lots.

FogHost therefore carries a minimal patch set in `GameDataWriter.cs` and
`ItemReader.cs`, and Task 11 defines the bridge inputs. Open items:
- no task builds or vendors the C# host yet;
- FogMod's `dist/` data is game-derived and its distribution is unresolved;
- the SoulsFormats/SoulsIds pins and SoulsIds' license are still to be checked.

Task 8 ran the combined Items + Enemies engine end to end for the first time:
typed request → config → vendored JS generator → real `DsrDataTool`
`scan`/`patch-enemies` → workspace package, via
`apps/backend/scripts/combinedEngineE2eProof.mjs` (harness commit
`75c214dc2656693b49c2861c39f3f2a7e6b8e7a8`; not part of `npm test`). The live Steam install is
legacy-modified (legacy item/enemy randomizers and FogMod applied in place);
against it `patch-enemies` correctly refuses (`DATA_TOOL_FAILED`, enemy model
declaration pruning), and the install stayed byte-identical. On a temp copy
of the tool's read set with the legacy `.bak` files restored, all 47 checks
passed (2026-09-28): generation completes, the package's 54 patched files
match `patch-manifest.json`, reruns are byte-identical apart from embedded
workspace paths and timestamps, real catalogs verify and reuse, failures are
typed and recoverable in the same workspace, and neither game directory
changed. This proves the pipeline on real-format data, not on verified
vanilla data. Findings handed to later tasks (up-front detection of
legacy-modified installs, partial seed directories after a failed patch,
missing dll reported as `DATA_TOOL_FAILED`, volatile JSON fields) are in
`docs/COMBINED_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md` ("End-to-end generation proof").
No application code changed; `@ds1tr/backend` stays `0.10.0`.

Task 7 connected `CombinedRandomizerAdapter.generate()` to the existing
workspace-only execution bridge. It forwards the typed request and
progress/log events, returns the generated seed package directory on success,
and preserves typed bridge failures including retryability. Two focused
adapter tests passed; backend build and typecheck passed (2026-09-28).
`@ds1tr/backend` is `0.10.0`. Implementation commit:
`57d2f846ca362b91673ffcaf3ae025802e5efb64`. The adapter has not yet
run `DsrDataTool` against a real DSR installation (Task 8); generation is
not connected to activation.

Task 6 resolved the remaining combined-engine blockers that had to be fixed
before a real generation run can be attempted: the combined seed is now a
32-hex-character SHA-256 derivation of the master seed that always satisfies
upstream's charset (Blocker 2); `CombinedRandomizerRequest` gained
`generateSpoilerLog`, mapped straight through instead of pinned off
(Blocker 3); and a reused workspace catalog is verified file-by-file (size +
SHA-256) against the game directory before generation, failing with
`CATALOG_SOURCE_MISMATCH` and never rescanning automatically (Blocker 6).
Backend tests 66/66 pass and the full workspace typecheck is clean
(2026-09-28). `@ds1tr/backend` is `0.9.0`. Implementation commit:
`e2664164d1aa1131952e1ddb1a19a87d960198af`. The user confirmed the seed
derivation (option A); `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `source-analysis.md`, and
`CODEX_PROGRESS.md` now mark the earlier pass-through direction superseded.
Task 7 completed adapter wiring. Still open: a real `DsrDataTool` run
(Task 8), the public GPL fork.

Task 5 extended the focused combined bridge tests (commit
`abeb4c2f56ade130a39e4d42837bf333d586e3e0`); no production code changed.

## Backend adapters

- The minimal `CombinedRandomizerAdapter` boundary is defined for combined item
  and enemy generation requests, progress/log events, and typed results.
- The adapter delegates generation to the workspace-only execution bridge and
  maps its package directory and typed failures to the public adapter result.
- The adapter is not yet invoked by the application pipeline. When called, it
  delegates workspace generation to the bridge; activation remains separate.
- A pure, deterministic mapping layer converts combined requests to the
  upstream item/enemy configuration shape, applies parent `enabled` flags, and
  rejects requests with no enabled randomization category. Task 3 verified
  all required item/enemy combinations, parent gating, deterministic output,
  and the case where only safeguard options are selected. Six focused mapper
  tests and backend build/typecheck passed on 2026-09-28. No generation,
  filesystem, subprocess, or game access was added.
- A pure, deterministic workspace planner
  (`combinedRandomizerWorkspace.ts`) computes the catalog path, per-seed
  output directory, and `scan`/`patch-enemies` argument vectors for a
  generation run, and refuses to plan a workspace located inside the live
  game directory. It performs no filesystem I/O and never constructs
  `install`/`restore` arguments. See
  `docs/COMBINED_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md` ("Workspace execution proof").
- `kellernz1/ds-randomizer` is selectively vendored (the files needed for
  `DsrDataTool.dll`, plus the minimal JavaScript generation core) and pinned
  at commit
  `f120efe0e95b957b7e76109868c3c9966e22720c` under
  `engines/combined/vendor/` (`UPSTREAM_PIN.md` has the full file list and
  update procedure). `DsrDataTool.dll` builds successfully from this
  vendor directory with a locally-installed .NET 8 SDK; see
  `docs/COMBINED_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md` ("Vendored build proof") for the
  exact command and artifact path.
- `DsrDataToolExecutor` runs only the planner-provided `scan` and
  `patch-enemies` argument vectors through Node `child_process.spawn`, streams
  typed stdout/stderr log events, emits coarse process-status events, and
  returns typed success, process-failure, or spawn-failure results. It is not
  wired into the adapter or generation pipeline yet. Task 1's implementation
  is in commit `5402b447f3d53a1896ca59267fc5fe10461bc071`; its seven
  focused tests, backend build, and backend typecheck passed on 2026-09-27.
  The task remains blocked because Git could not create `.git/index.lock` to
  commit the task's plan/status update under the current filesystem policy.
- The upstream JavaScript generation core is vendored at the same pinned
  commit under `engines/combined/vendor/src/` — five files, the transitive
  closure of `generate()` and `writeOutput()`
  (`core/{config,generator,output,rng}.js`, `data/prototype-data.js`), with a
  closed import graph of Node builtins only. CLI, HTTP, Electron, share-link,
  catalog-loading, and game-detection modules are deliberately excluded.
- `combinedRandomizerCore.ts` is the backend's single loading boundary for
  that core: a computed dynamic `import()` of `file:` URLs resolved from
  `import.meta.url`, hand-written types for the six upstream exports (so the
  vendored bytes stay byte-identical), and typed `JS_CORE_MISSING` /
  `JS_CORE_INCOMPLETE` failures instead of thrown errors. It loads and
  shape-checks the core; it does not call `generate()` or `writeOutput()`
  yet. See `docs/COMBINED_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md` ("JS core vendor proof").
- Vendored-file identity is verified by comparing Git blob object IDs against
  the pinned upstream commit, not by `diff`: `core.autocrlf` rewrites line
  endings on Windows checkout. All twelve vendored files verified; object IDs
  recorded in `engines/combined/vendor/UPSTREAM_PIN.md`.
- Documentation correction: upstream `validateConfig(config, { requireGame })`
  **returns** a `string[]` of errors and never throws. The earlier analysis
  said it throws; consumers must check the returned array.
- A minimal combined-engine execution bridge
  (`apps/backend/src/adapters/combinedRandomizerBridge.ts`,
  `executeCombinedGeneration`) now chains all five previously independent
  pieces into one internal path: typed request → pure config mapping → the
  vendored JS core (`normalizeConfig`/`validateConfig`/`generate`/
  `writeOutput`) → the pure workspace planner → the `DsrDataTool` executor
  (`scan` when the workspace has no catalog, then `patch-enemies`). It
  returns a typed success carrying the package directory, placements path,
  `patch-manifest.json` path, upstream version, placement hash, and seed, or
  one of fifteen documented failure codes (`CATALOG_SOURCE_MISMATCH` added
  by Task 6). Only `GENERATION_FAILED` is
  marked retryable. See `docs/COMBINED_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md` ("Execution
  bridge proof") for the exact data flow.
- Generation is proven workspace-only against fixtures: 19 focused tests run
  the real vendored `generate()`/`writeOutput()` in a temporary workspace
  with a synthetic schema-17 catalog, faking only the `DsrDataTool` process
  layer. They assert a real package is produced with
  `dataStatus: "extracted"`, that the process layer receives the planner's
  exact `scan`/`patch-enemies` argument vectors and nothing else, that the
  placements file exists before `patch-enemies` is invoked, that a fixture
  game directory is byte-identical before and after a successful run, and
  that the same request twice yields the same placement hash. Backend tests
  54/54 pass; backend build and the full workspace typecheck are clean
  (2026-09-28).
- The bridge rejects `dataStatus !== "extracted"` before writing any file and
  before spawning any process, so integration Blocker 1's silent prototype
  fallback can no longer reach a package directory. It also pre-checks
  `catalog.schemaVersion !== 17` so an obsolete catalog reports
  `CATALOG_STALE` instead of an opaque generation error.
- The bridge plans the workspace from the **normalized** upstream seed rather
  than the raw request seed, because upstream derives its own
  `seed_<safeSeed>` package directory from the normalized value; planning
  from the raw value would point `--placements` at a file upstream never
  wrote. See `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Three upstream config keys are pinned by the bridge rather than inherited
  from `defaultConfig`: `generateSpoilerLog: false` (no request field exists —
  Blocker 3 — and the upstream default `true` would emit an unrequested
  spoiler file), plus `useExtractedData: true` and `dryRun: false`, both
  verified inert at the pinned commit (read nowhere in the vendored core or
  `DsrDataTool`).
- Fixed: `core/pipeline.ts`'s combined-engine probe pointed at
  `vendor/src/cli.js` and `vendor/DSR-Randomizer.exe`, neither of which
  exists or should, so engine status always reported the combined engine as
  missing. It now probes `vendor/src/core/generator.js` and the built
  `vendor/tools/DsrDataTool/bin/Release/net8.0/DsrDataTool.dll`, with a test
  asserting the combined engine reports `source` mode. The bridge itself
  never consults `ExternalAdapter`.
- Still not done: the bridge has never executed the real `DsrDataTool` against
  a real Dark Souls installation, so a genuine `scan`/`patch-enemies` round trip is
  unproven. Blockers 2, 3, and 6 were resolved by Task 6 (see
  `docs/COMBINED_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md`, "Blocker resolution"); the public
  GPL fork remains open.
