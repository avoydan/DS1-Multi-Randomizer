## Workspace containment is enforced before any upstream call, not only by upstream itself

Date: 2026-09-27

`kellernz1/ds-randomizer`'s `patch-enemies` already refuses to write
outside a caller-supplied output directory into the live game directory
(`docs/COMBINED_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md`, "Workspace execution proof"). We do
not rely on that upstream guard alone. `planCombinedRandomizerWorkspace()`
(`apps/backend/src/adapters/combinedRandomizerWorkspace.ts`) independently
rejects a workspace path equal to, or nested inside, the game directory in
pure TypeScript, before any path is ever handed to a subprocess.

Why: defense in depth for a irreversible-if-wrong operation (writing into
a user's live game install), and it keeps the safety check testable without
the upstream binary present. Consistent with the workspace policy in
`AGENTS.md` ("Avoid modifying the live DSR installation during
intermediate generation").

This module never constructs `install`/`restore` argument vectors at all —
those commands are the only upstream commands that write into `--game`,
and are intentionally not called from generation.
